<p> Am the person who loves to travel the world with loved ones, as like above pics.One of the traveling benefits is finding and keeping humility. Too often, people get wrapped up in their lives, their daily routine of working, sleeping, eating and living. They become self-absorbed to the point it affects their health, their happiness, and their perspective. In order to get out of that i like to travel. I want to be a shark in the ocean not to be a fish in the pond.</p>

<p> I am from the village called chinna seeragapadi. I love the place by my heart and it looks beautiful with scenic plans and trees. I was living with my family when i was in college .
Neverthless to say, i had my cute grandma with me and we found an interesting habit of planting trees to add more color and nature to our village.
